# Disguising your virus
Disguising your virus can be challenging depending on what it does, if it goes around doing blatant stuff like deleting files,
moving folders and writing new files, you will have a problem.

## String contents / method names
Some antiviruses will attempt to disassemble your executable and check the method names and string contents,
you are going to want to obfuscate your code in a non-obvious way.

## Take your time
Do not act instantaniously, this is one way to mess up the whole process and let any sysadmin know they
are about to be pwned if they do not do something quickly.
