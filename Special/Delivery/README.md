# Delivery & packaging

This is the most important part for sure, it is getting the user to download
your malicious software. How do we do it? Well that is what this is all
about. Sit back, relax, grab a cup of coffee and enjoy the read!


## Website vulnerabilities

Websites are vulnerable to many things, there is no way to fix this.
There will always be a problem with all websites, so we must embrace
this and use it to our advantage.

Take for example the URL `https://google.com`, this site is trusted
yet we can exploit a weakness in these "trusted" sites. Depending
on the community in which you are attacking and convincing to install
your malware, you will have to find the weakness in the relevant site.

Open redirections are one of the top ways to get people with no real
knowledge on computers / websites to download terrible things. Take
for example the URL: `https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&url=http://example.org/&usg=AOvVaw1YigBkNF7L7D2x2Fl532mA`
It redirects you to the target site, please note this is not an active
vulnerability in google and example.org is just a trusted domain in the
eyes of google.

## Social engineering

Most people are very trusting of any "HTTPS" secured site they visit,
why? Because their browser says it is secure. This is a common
misconception and is not usually spoken about, therefore we can exploit it.

For example, one could setup a site for a "game cheat" that wants the user to
download and install "Winrar" so they can unzip the packaged software. But
when they click the download button on the attackers site, it downloads a file
and redirects them to the official "thank you" download page. They run it and
that is the end of them.

One could also use fake antivirus "badges" that say the site is safe, this is
a common way telephone scammers manage to convince poor unsuspecting victims
to trust their site.
